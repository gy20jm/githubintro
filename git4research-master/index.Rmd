# Preface {-}

Over the years we have seen how version control can increase the quality of collaborative research.
Before GitHub and collaborative tools, research projects beyond a certain size tended to descend into a mess.

<!-- Example of mess -->

<!-- How GitHub's approach overcomes this, e.g. with reference to a project we've worked on -->

This book project aims to distill the lessons we've learned along the way into a cohesive knowledge chunk, accessible as possible to anyone interested in improving their research workflows.
Thanks to the **bookdown** package  [@R-bookdown], it is now relatively easy to create entire books that are reproducible and open source, removing an important barrier to learning and innovation:
information.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
